-------------------
When the user plays 'Word Guess', the computer first selects a secret
word at random from a list built into the program. The program then
prints out a row of dashesâ€”one for each letter in the secret word
and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter
that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances
of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any
letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does
not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess.
The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has
correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user
has made EIGHT incorrect guesses.
